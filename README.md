# Introduction

The operator is a video game that has been created during the 2018 Global Game Jam, at Toulouse, France.
Global game jam is a worldwide event where participants have to create a videogame in 48 hours. The main word of the jam was "transmission", so we had to create a game with this "topic".

# Aim of the game
"You are a telephonic operator at the white house. Your Job ? Answer to all Incomming calls from the 35 different NPC, listen what they need, and redirect the call to someone else. But don't you dare think that this job is easy ! They are not all patient, or very precise about what they need."
